# NotifyLight Project: Revert Test Applications (Prompt 2-5)

## Context
I'm working on NotifyLight, a lightweight notification platform. Previously, I had test applications created per prompt 2-5, but I need to revert this work and clean up the project structure.

## Task: Clean Reversion of Test Applications

### What to Remove
**Delete these directories and all contents:**
- `test-apps/` (entire directory)
  - `test-apps/react-native/`
  - `test-apps/ios-native/`
  - `test-apps/utilities/`
  - `test-apps/docs/`

**Remove from documentation:**
- Any references to test applications in README files
- Links to test app setup guides
- Testing procedures that reference the removed apps

### What to Preserve
**Keep all core project files:**
- SDK source code (React Native, iOS SDKs)
- Backend/server code
- Core documentation (API docs, main README)
- Docker configuration
- Package.json files for SDKs
- Git history and commit messages

### Git Operations Required
1. **Clean removal**: `git rm -r test-apps/`
2. **Update .gitignore**: Remove any test-app specific ignores
3. **Commit message**: "Revert: Remove test applications from prompt 2-5"

### Documentation Updates
**Update main README.md:**
- Remove sections about test applications
- Remove setup instructions that reference test apps
- Keep core SDK integration examples (if any)

**Update any SDK documentation:**
- Remove references to test app examples
- Keep simple integration snippets inline

### Verification Steps
After reversion, verify:
- [ ] No test-apps/ directory exists
- [ ] No broken links in documentation
- [ ] Core SDK files are intact
- [ ] Git history is preserved
- [ ] Project builds successfully
- [ ] No orphaned configuration files

## Expected Outcome
Clean project structure focused on core NotifyLight platform without test application bloat. The project should be ready for proper MVP development following the roadmap.

## Notes
- This is a feature branch, so no backward compatibility concerns
- Focus on clean, minimal structure aligned with "radical simplicity" principle
- If any testing infrastructure is needed later, we'll build it purpose-built for actual needs
