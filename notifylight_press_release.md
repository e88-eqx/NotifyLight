## NotifyLight: Reclaim Your Mobile Notifications. 95% Cost Savings, 90% Faster Implementation.

### New Self-Hosted, Open-Source Solution Eliminates Bloat, Complexity, and Vendor Lock-in from Enterprise Notification Tools

**NEW YORK, NY ‚Äì [DATE]** ‚Äì NotifyLight, a new developer-focused company, today announced its revolutionary notification platform that delivers enterprise-grade in-app messaging and push notifications with radical simplicity. Built by engineers who experienced firsthand the frustration with expensive, over-engineered solutions like Pendo and OneSignal, NotifyLight enables developers to implement comprehensive notification systems in hours instead of weeks, at a fraction of the cost. The company's flagship customer, Equivalent Exchange (EQX), a high-frequency crypto trading platform, has already achieved remarkable results using the platform in production.

"Building a high-frequency trading platform taught us the critical importance of lean, reliable infrastructure," said [FOUNDER_NAME], CTO and Co-founder of NotifyLight. "When milliseconds matter and system reliability is non-negotiable, you learn to eliminate everything that isn't essential. We apply that same engineering rigor to NotifyLight‚Äîno bloat, no vendor dependencies, just reliable message delivery when you need it."

## The Problem: Enterprise Notification Tools Have Lost Touch with Developer Needs

Today's notification platforms were designed for enterprise marketing teams, resulting in solutions that have become a source of frustration for developers worldwide. Companies find themselves trapped in expensive contracts for tools that require weeks of integration time just to send basic messages to users. Developers are tired of wrestling with bloated SDKs and marketing-heavy dashboards just to send a notification about a new feature or system update.

The current landscape forces teams to choose between:
- **Prohibitively Expensive Platforms**: Companies pay $500-$2,000+ monthly for complex features they never use
- **Over-Engineered Solutions**: Weeks of integration time and ongoing maintenance for basic functionality  
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Complex migrations and dependency on third-party roadmaps
- **Feature Bloat**: Marketing automation tools disguised as developer infrastructure

"Most companies just want to send users a message about new features or important updates," explained [PRODUCT_LEAD_NAME], Head of Product at NotifyLight. "Why should that require a $50,000 annual contract and a dedicated team member?"

## Introducing NotifyLight: Notification Infrastructure Made Simple

NotifyLight is a self-hosted, open-source notification platform that provides:

### **Lightning-Fast Implementation**
- **10-minute setup**: Single API endpoint deployment
- **5-line integration**: Minimal code changes to existing React Native and Swift apps
- **Zero configuration**: Works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults
- **Minimal Footprint**: No heavy SDKs or unnecessary dependencies to bloat your app
- **Pure API-Driven**: Control everything from your backend, not a complex UI
- **Native protocols**: Direct integration with iOS APNs and Android FCM

### **Radical Cost Savings**
- **$0 licensing fees**: Completely free and open-source
- **Sub-$10 monthly hosting**: Runs efficiently on minimal cloud infrastructure
- **No vendor lock-in**: Own your data and infrastructure
- **Scale-as-needed**: Pay only for actual usage

### **Essential Features Only**
- **In-App Modals**: Clean, customizable message overlays
- **Push Notifications**: Reliable delivery via native iOS and Android protocols
- **Basic Targeting**: Simple user segmentation and scheduling
- **Analytics**: Core metrics without complexity
- **Self-Hosted**: Complete control over data and compliance

"We've eliminated everything that isn't absolutely essential," said [LEAD_ENGINEER_NAME], Lead Engineer at NotifyLight. "NotifyLight does one thing exceptionally well: gets your message to your users reliably and simply."

## Early Results: 95% Cost Reduction, 90% Faster Implementation

During production testing at EQX, a high-frequency crypto trading platform, NotifyLight demonstrated remarkable efficiency:

- **Implementation Time**: 2 hours vs. 3 weeks with previous enterprise solution (90% faster)
- **Monthly Costs**: $8 hosting vs. $1,500 enterprise licensing (95% cost reduction)
- **Message Delivery**: 99.7% success rate with sub-200ms latency
- **Developer Productivity**: "Finally, a tool that just works, freeing up our engineers for core product development" - EQX Engineering Team

This efficiency gain allowed EQX to refocus critical engineering resources on building features for their core trading platform, rather than managing third-party notification tools. "The time we saved on notification infrastructure let us ship two major trading features ahead of schedule," noted [EQX_LEAD_ENGINEER_NAME], Lead Engineer at EQX.

"Our trading platform requires absolute reliability and transparency in every component," noted [EQX_CEO_NAME], CEO of Equivalent Exchange. "NotifyLight embodies the same principles that guide our exchange: no gimmicks, no complexity, just reliable performance at a fair cost."

## Industry Validation and Early Interest

"The notification tool market has become bloated with enterprise features that small and medium companies don't need," said Sarah Chen, Principal Analyst at DevTools Research. "There's a clear gap in the market for a simple, cost-effective solution that focuses on core functionality." This sentiment is echoed by industry analysts, who see a clear shift away from monolithic solutions toward focused, developer-first tools.

Several companies have already expressed interest in NotifyLight:

**"As a fintech startup, we need reliable notifications without the enterprise overhead. NotifyLight gives us exactly what we need at a price point that makes sense for our stage."** 
*‚Äì Michael Torres, CTO, ClearPay Financial*

*‚Äì Jennifer Walsh, Head of Engineering, StreamlineHQ*

**"The transparency and engineering rigor that goes into high-frequency trading infrastructure is exactly what the developer tools space needs. Simple, honest solutions without vendor lock-in."** 
*‚Äì David Kim, Senior Developer, AlgoTrade Systems*
