Prompt 3.2: Setup Verification Script
Finally, let's create the crucial setup verification script for the MVP.

Goal: Create a simple, executable shell script (setup-verify.sh) that a developer can run after deploying the backend to automatically test the full notification flow without requiring a mobile app initially.

Constraints for MVP:

Language: Shell script (bash).

Purpose: Verifies backend API endpoints for:

Health check (basic server response).

POST /register-device with a dummy device.

POST /notify (push type) to the dummy device.

POST /notify (in-app type) to the dummy device.

GET /in-app-message/:userId for the dummy device.

Output: Clear, concise messages indicating success or failure for each step.

API Key: Reads API_KEY from the environment or .env file for testing.

Dummy Data: Uses generated unique IDs for testing.

Task:

Provide the setup-verify.sh script.

Include comments in the script explaining each step.

Provide instructions on how to run it from the root of the backend repo.

Explain:

How the script validates each API endpoint.

The use of dummy data and unique IDs to avoid conflicts during testing.

Any prerequisites for running the script (e.g., curl, jq).
