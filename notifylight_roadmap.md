# NotifyLight 3-Stage Product Roadmap

## Strategic Philosophy
**Core Principle**: Each stage must deliver undeniable value while maintaining radical simplicity. We build the minimum viable feature set that solves real problems, then iterate based on user feedback. No feature bloat, no vendor lock-in, no unnecessary complexity.

**Success Measure**: Can a developer implement NotifyLight in under 2 hours and see immediate value?

---

## Stage 1: MVP - "Prove the Core Value" (Q2 2025)
**Duration**: 8-10 weeks  
**Primary Users**: EQX (internal) + 5-10 external beta users  
**Core Goal**: Validate that our "lightweight, fast implementation" promise delivers real value

### Core Functionality
- **Simple In-App Notifications**
  - Modal overlays with title, description only (images deferred to Stage 2)
  - Manual triggering via API calls to all users
  - Basic user dismissal (no "don't show again" - too complex for MVP)
  
- **Push Notifications**
  - Direct integration with iOS APNs and Android FCM
  - Text-only push notifications (no deep linking in MVP)
  - Device token management and registration
  - Basic delivery confirmation tracking

- **Notification Management**
  - Single REST endpoint: `POST /notify` for immediate delivery
  - **No scheduling in MVP** - send now only (scheduling adds complexity)
  - **No templates in MVP** - raw JSON payload for maximum simplicity
  - Basic delivery status logging (delivered/failed)

### Developer Experience (DX)
- **React Native SDK**
  - Single `npm install notifylight-react-native` with zero configuration
  - 2-method API: `NotifyLight.init(apiKey)`, `NotifyLight.handleIncomingNotification()`
  - Typescript definitions included
  - Automatic initialization with sensible defaults
  
- **Swift iOS SDK**
  - CocoaPods installation: `pod 'NotifyLight'`
  - 1-line setup in AppDelegate: `NotifyLight.configure(apiKey: "key")`
  - Automatic APNs token registration
  
- **API Design**
  - **Simple API Key Authentication** (not JWT for MVP simplicity)
  - Single endpoint: `POST /notify` with API key in header
  - JSON payload: `{title, message, users: ["all"] or ["user1", "user2"]}`
  - Clear HTTP status codes and error messages
  
- **Documentation**
  - **10-minute quickstart guide** covering:
    - Docker deployment (3 commands)
    - SDK integration (2 lines of code each platform)
    - Send first notification (1 API call)
    - Verify delivery in logs
  - **Critical missing piece**: Setup verification script to test full flow

### Infrastructure/Backend
- **Ultra-Simple Tech Stack for MVP**
  - **Backend**: Node.js with Express (most familiar)
  - **Database**: **SQLite for MVP** (single file, zero configuration, perfect for testing)
  - **Queue**: In-memory queue for MVP (Redis deferred to Stage 2)
  - **Auth**: Simple API key validation (stored in environment variables)
  
- **Core Services (Minimal)**
  - Single notification service with basic retry (3 attempts)
  - In-memory device token storage (persisted to SQLite)
  - Basic logging to console/file
  - **No separate analytics service** - just delivery status in SQLite
  
- **Ultra-Simple Self-Hosting**
  - **One-command deployment**: `npx notifylight-setup`
  - **Alternative**: Docker Compose with `.env` file for configuration
  - **Setup verification script**: Included script that tests full notification flow
  - Environment variables: `API_KEY`, `APNS_KEY_PATH`, `FCM_SERVER_KEY`

### Community/Open Source
- **GitHub Repository**
  - Complete source code with MIT license
  - **Optimized for beta user engagement**:
    - Issue template specifically for "First 15 minutes feedback"
    - Quick contribution guide for beta users
    - Automated testing with clear status badges
  
- **Beta User Engagement Strategy**
  - **Week 1-2**: Individual onboarding calls with each beta user
  - **Week 3-8**: Weekly "beta feedback sessions" (30 min, recorded)
  - **Specific ask**: "Can you implement in under 2 hours?" documentation
  - **Beta reward**: Feature naming rights, early access to Stage 2
  - **Discord channel**: Private beta channel for real-time support

### Metrics for Success (Measurable within 8-10 weeks)
- **Implementation Speed**: 100% of beta users complete integration in under 90 minutes (measurable via feedback form)
- **First Notification Success**: 100% of beta users send their first notification within first session
- **Delivery Reliability**: >95% notification delivery success rate (lowered from 99% for MVP realism)
- **Performance**: <500ms API response times, <512MB memory usage (realistic for MVP)
- **Beta Satisfaction**: 100% of beta users would recommend to a colleague (small sample, high bar)
- **Community**: 5-10 active beta users + 2-3 external contributors (GitHub issues/PRs)

### Dependencies & Risks
- **Technical Risk**: Push notification delivery across iOS/Android versions
- **Product Risk**: Feature scope creep during development  
- **Beta Risk**: Low beta user engagement or negative feedback
- **MVP-Specific Risk**: SQLite limitations if beta users have high volume needs
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Extensive device testing matrix for push notifications
  - Strict feature freeze after week 4
  - Proactive beta user communication and support
  - Clear upgrade path from SQLite to PostgreSQL for high-volume users
